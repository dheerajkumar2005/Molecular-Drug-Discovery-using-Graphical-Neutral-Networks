### Week 2: Understanding Advanced Neural Networks and Graph Neural Networks


**Part 1(Neural Networks and CNN) (till 23rd December)**
- **Resources**: 
  - To get the intuition of ReLU activation, read this article: [Visualizing Piecewise Linear Neural Networks](https://blog.janestreet.com/visualizing-piecewise-linear-neural-networks/).
  - Go over this [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) to learn more about neural networks.

### Linear Algebra (Can refer to these if you are uncomfortable with matrices stuff)
- If you feel uncomfortable with the matrices stuff in algorithms, you can refer to this for basic notations https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-linear-algebra-operations/
- Here are MA110 course [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rz87xpr-HtjrLb6uKPfRboQpPd-EKeqe/view?usp=drive_link) to get in more depth.
- Some important matrix operations:-

### Understanding Basics of CNN 
 - https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-convolutional-neural-networks-cnns
 - https://medium.com/@RaghavPrabhu/understanding-of-convolutional-neural-network-cnn-deep-learning-99760835f148
 - https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning (optional, you can refer to it to get to more depth and also various famous CNN architectures)

**Assignment (deadline: 23 Dec)**
 - Implement convolutional neural network to classify digits on MNIST dataset using pytorch(refer to week 1 [optional tutorials](https://youtu.be/c36lUUr864M?si=ipK9wX2L0EgOtZHV) to understand pytorch syntax)
 - **(optional)** Go through the object detection section in this [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning), and implement object detection model on pascal voc dataset. 
 - Main idea is to get the intuition of how CNN works, you can do experimentation and play with various parameters to get more understanding.
