### Week 2: Understanding Advanced Neural Networks and Graph Neural Networks


**Part 1(Neural Networks and CNN) (till 23rd December)**
- **Resources**: 
  - To get the intuition of ReLU activation, read this article: [Visualizing Piecewise Linear Neural Networks](https://blog.janestreet.com/visualizing-piecewise-linear-neural-networks/).
  - Go over this [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) to learn more about neural networks.

### Linear Algebra (Can refer to these if you are uncomfortable with matrices stuff)
- If you feel uncomfortable with the matrices stuff in algorithms, you can refer to this for basic notations https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-linear-algebra-operations/
- Here are MA110 course [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rz87xpr-HtjrLb6uKPfRboQpPd-EKeqe/view?usp=drive_link) to get in more depth.
- Some important matrix operations:-
  - https://atmos.washington.edu/~dennis/MatrixCalculus.pdf,

### Understanding Basics of CNN 
 - https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-convolutional-neural-networks-cnns
 - https://medium.com/@RaghavPrabhu/understanding-of-convolutional-neural-network-cnn-deep-learning-99760835f148
 - https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning (optional, you can refer to it to get to more depth and also various famous CNN architectures)

**Assignment (deadline: 23 Dec)**
 - Implement convolutional neural network to classify digits on MNIST dataset using pytorch(refer to week 1 [optional tutorials](https://youtu.be/c36lUUr864M?si=ipK9wX2L0EgOtZHV) to understand pytorch syntax)
 - **(optional)** Go through the object detection section in this [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning), and implement object detection model on pascal voc dataset. 
 - Main idea is to get the intuition of how CNN works, you can do experimentation and play with various parameters to get more understanding.

### Week 3 (Graphical Neural Networks and related stuff)

### Introduction to Graph Data Structure
- [Graph Data Structure - tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/graph_data_structure.htm) (till representation of graph)

### Graph representation in Machine learning 
  -  [Unsupervised Node Embedding](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/02-nodeemb.pdf) ( you can skip the mathematical part of node2vec if its too heavy. The main idea of this reading is to learn how graph nodes are embedded by just utilising structure of the graph )
  
### Introduction to GNN
  -  [Understanding GNNs](https://distill.pub/2021/understanding-gnns/)
  - https://medium.com/@tejpal.abhyuday/introduction-to-graph-neural-networks-gnns-f79ca974a57d

### GCN
